                     <p class="Then"> Born and rised in the summer haze. 
                        <br> Techincally in the Spring of 1997. 
                        <br>Being the youngest of 6 really taught me to view life through a different lense.
                        <br> My family means the world to me, because it was just my siblings and I growing up, no extended family.
                         <br>Until everyone began growing their own families. A small family of six turned into a family of 25.</p>
                <h2>Now </h2>
                <p class="Now">I have a crazy three year old. He literally rules my world, in a good way.  Donnie is his name, he is obsessed with the Dino Charge Power Rangers, outer space, dinosours, and french fries. <br>
                    He also has a very vivid imagination and loves to dress up. I think that is why he loves Halloween the best; this year I had to go on a mission to find his coustume. 
                    <br>The Gold Power Ranger of course! Absolutely no stores had it, no thrift stores either, so my last resort; Amazon.

                 </p>    
                 <p>Donnie surprises me each and every day. I believe that what I learned growing up really helped me when i became a mom myself. <br> I can only hope that when he grows up and has a family of his own, he wil keep the same values I taught him and pass it on to next generations. <br>Also I definitely hope he continues to play dress-up even when he reaches old age! </p>
